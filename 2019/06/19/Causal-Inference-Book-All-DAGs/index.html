<p>This is my preliminary attempt to organize and present all the DAGs from Miguel Hernan and Jamie Robin’s excellent <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/">Causal Inference Book</a>.  So far, I’ve only done Part I.</p>

<p>I love the Causal Inference book, but sometimes I find it easy to lose track of the variables when I read it.  Having the variables right alongside the DAG makes it easier for me to remember what’s going on, especially when the book refers back to a DAG from a previous chapter and I don’t want to dig back through the text. Plus, making this was a great exercise!</p>

<p>Again, this page is meant to be fairly raw and only contain the DAGs. If you use it, you might also find it useful to open up <a href="https://sgfin.github.io/2019/06/19/Causal-Inference-Book-Glossary-and-Notes/">this page</a>, which is where I have more traditional notes covering the main concepts from the book. But of course, the text itself has no substitute.</p>

<h3 id="refresher-visual-rules-of-d-separation">Refresher: Visual rules of d-separation.</h3>

<p>Two variables on a DAG are <strong>d-separated</strong> if all paths between them are blocked. The following four rules defined what it means to be “blocked.”</p>

<p>(This is just meant to be a refresher – see the second half of this post or Fine Point 6.1 of the text for more definitions.)</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">Rule</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">1. If there are no variables being conditioned on, a path is blocked if and only if two arrowheads on the path collide at some variable on the path.</td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/hernan_dags/6_1.png" width="175" /> <br /><br /> \(L \rightarrow A \rightarrow Y\) is open. <br /><br /> \(A \rightarrow Y \leftarrow L\) is blocked at \(Y\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">2. Any path that contains a noncollider that has been conditioned on is blocked.</td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/hernan_dags/6_5.png" width="175" /> <br /><br /> Conditioning on \(B\) blocks the path from \(A\) to \(Y\).</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">4. A collider that has a descendant that has been conditioned on does not block a path.</td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/hernan_dags/6_8.png" width="175" /> <br /><br /> The path between \(A\) and \(Y\) is open after conditioning on \(C\), a descendant of collider \(L\).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="refresher-backdoor-criterion">Refresher: Backdoor criterion</h3>

<p>Assuming positivity and consistency, confounding can be eliminated and causal effects are identifiable in the following two settings:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">Rule</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">1. No common causes of treatment and outcome.</td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/hernan_dags/6_2.png" width="150" /> <br /><br /> There are no common causes of treatment and outcome. Hence no backdoor paths need to be blocked. <br /><br /> No confounding; equivalent to a marginally randomized trial.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">2. Common causes are present, but there are enough measured variables to block all colliders. (i.e. No unmeasured confounding.)</td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/hernan_dags/6_1.png" width="175" /> <br /><br /> Backdoor path through the common cause \(L\) can be blocked by conditioning on measured covariates (in this case, \(L\) itself) that are non-descendants of treatment. <br /><br /> There will be no residual confounding after controlling for \(L\); equivalent to a conditionally randomized trial.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>And now we can finally:</p>

      <td>In this study design, the average causal effect of \(A\) on \(Y\) is computed after matching on \(L\). <br /><br /> Before matching, \(L\) and \(A\) are associated via the path \(L \rightarrow A\) . <br /><br /> Matching is represented in the DAG through the addition of \(S\), the selection criteria. The study is obviously restricted to patients that are selected (\(S\)=1), hence we condition on \(S\). <br /><br /> d-separation rules say that there are now two open paths between \(A\) and \(L\) after conditioning on \(S\):  \(L \rightarrow A\) and \(L \rightarrow S \leftarrow A\). This seems to indicate an association between \(L\) and \(A\).  However, the point of matching is supposed to be to make sure that \(L\) and \(A\) not associated! <br /><br />  The resolution comes from the observation that \(S\) has been constructed specifically to induce the distribution of \(L\) to be the same in the treated (\(A\)=1) and untreated (\(A\)=0) population. This means that the association in \(L \rightarrow S \leftarrow A\) is of equal magnitude but opposite direction of \(L \rightarrow A\). Thus there is no net association between \(A\) and \(L\). <br /><br />  This disconnect between the associations visible in the DAG and the associations actually present is an example of <strong>unfaithfulness</strong>, but here it has been introduced by design.</td>

      <td>The purpose of this example is to show the potential for selection bias in <em>time-specific hazard ratios</em>. <br /><br /> The example depicts a <em>randomized experiment</em> representing the effect of heart transplant on risk of death at two time points, for which we assume the true causal DAG is figure 8.8. <br /><br /> In figure 8.8, we assume that \(A\) only directly affects death at the first time point and that \(U\) decreases risk of death at all times but doesn’t affect treatment. <br /><br /> In this circumstance, the unconditional associated risk ratios are not confounded.  In other words, \(aRR_{AY_1} = \frac{[Y_{1}|A=1]}{[Y_{1}|A=0]}\) and  \(aRR_{AY_2} = \frac{[Y_{2}|A=1]}{[Y_{2}|A=0]}\) are unbiased and valid for causal inference. <br /><br /> However, trying to compute time-specific hazard ratios is risky. The process is valid at time point 1 (\(aRR_{AY_1}\) is the same as above), but the hazard ratio at time point 2 is inherently conditional on having survived at time point 1: \(aRR_{AY_2|Y_{1}=0} = \frac{[Y_{2}|A=1,Y_{1}=0]}{[Y_{2}|A=0,Y_{1}=0]}\). Since \(U\) affects survival at time point 1, however, this induces a selection bias that opens a path \(A\rightarrow Y_{1} \leftarrow U \rightarrow Y_{2}\) beteween \(A\) and \(Y_2\).  <br /><br /> If we could condition on \(U\), then \(aRR_{AY_2|Y_{1}=0,U}\) would be valid for causal inference. But we can’t, so conditioning on \(Y_{1}=0\) makes the DAG functionally equivalent to Figure 8.9.  This issue is relevant to observational and randomized experiments over time.</td>

      <td>This example is of an <strong>RCT with censoring</strong>. We imagine that there was in reality an equal number of deaths in treatment and control, but there was higher censoring (\(C=1\)) among patients with heart disease and higher censoring among the wasabi arm.  As such, we observe more deaths in the wasabi group than in control. Thus, we see a <strong>selection bias</strong> due to <strong>conditioning on common effect</strong> \(C\). <br /><br /> There are <em>no common causes</em> of \(A\) and \(Y\) – expected in a marginally randomized experiment – so there is no need to adjust for <em>confounding</em> per se.  However, there is a common cause \(U\) of both \(C\) and \(Y\), inducing a backdoor path \(C \leftarrow L \leftarrow U \rightarrow Y\).  As such, conditioning on non-censored patients \(C=0\) means we have a selection bias that turns \(U\) functionally into a confounder. \(U\) is unmeasured, but the backdoor criterion says that <strong>adjusting for \(L\)</strong> here blocks the backdoor path. <br /><br /> The takeaway here is that <strong>censoring or other selection changes the causal question</strong>, and turns the counterfactual outcome into \(Y^{a=1,c=0}\) – the outcome of receiving the treatment <em>and</em> being uncensored.  The relevant causal risk ratio, for example, is thus now \(\frac{E[Y^{a=1,c=0}]}{E[Y^{a=0,c=0}]}\) – “the risk if everyone had been treated and was uncensored” vs “the risk if everyone were untreated and remained uncensored.” In this sense, <strong>censoring is another treatment</strong>.</td>

      <td>In this example, Figure 8.12, surgery \(A\) and haplotype \(E\) are: <br /> (i) marginally independent (i.e. haplotype doesn’t affect probability of receiving surgery), and <br /> (ii) associated conditionally on \(Y\) (i.e. probability of receiving surgery <em>does</em> vary by haplotype within at least one stratum of the haplotype). <br /><br /> The purpose of this example is to show that despite this fact, situations exist in which \(A\) and \(E\) remain conditionally independent within <em>some</em> haplotypes. <br /><br /> Key idea here is that to recognize that if you split death into different causes (even if this isn’t recorded), \(A\) and \(E\) affect different sub-causes in different ways (specifically, \(A\) removes tumor, and \(E\) prevents heart attack). <br /><br /> Arrows from \(Y_{A}\), \(Y_{E}\), and \(Y_{O}\) to \(Y\) are deterministic, and \(Y=0\) if and only if \(Y_{A} = Y_{E}=Y_{O}=0\), so conditioning on \(Y_{0}=0\) implicitly conditions the other \(Y\)s to zero. This also blocks the path between \(A\) and \(E\), since it is conditioning on non-colliders \(Y_{A}\), \(Y_{E}\), and \(Y_{O}\). <br /><br /> In contrast, conditioning on \(Y=1\) is compatible with any combination of \(Y_{A}\), \(Y_{E}\), and \(Y_{O}\) being equal to 1, so the path between \(A\) and \(E\) is not blocked. <br /><br /> The ability to break the conditional probability of survival down in this way is an example of a <strong>multiplicative survival model</strong>.</td>

      <td>Figure 9.9 is the same idea as Figure 9.8:  Even though controlling for \(L\) <em>would</em> be sufficient, a mismatched \(L^{*}\) is insufficient to block the backdoor path in general. <br /><br /> Another note here is that <strong>mismeasurement of confounders can result in apparent effect modification</strong>. For example, if all participants who reported a history of heart disease (\(L^{*}=1\)) and half the participants who reported no such history (\(L^{*}=0\)) actually had heart disease, then stratifying on (\(L^{*}=1\)) would eliminate all confounding in that stratum, but statifying on (\(L^{*}=0\)) would fail to do so.
