<p>This page contains some notes from Miguel Hernan and Jamie Robin’s <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/">Causal Inference Book</a>.  So far, I’ve only done Part I.</p>

<p>This page only has key terms and concepts. On <a href="https://sgfin.github.io/2019/06/19/Causal-Inference-Book-All-DAGs/">this page</a>, I’ve tried to systematically present all the DAGs in the same book.  I imagine that one will be more useful going forward, at least for me.</p>
